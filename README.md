# Flight Delay Prediction using ML

This project consists of three phases:<br>
1. Data Preprocessing<br>
2. Classification<br>
3. Regression<br>

The code has been split into four Google Colaboratory Notebooks:<br>
1. FlightData<br>
2. WeatherData<br>
3. TrainTest<br>
4. DelayPredict<br>

All data has been stored in a Google Drive folder as the CSV files are too large to upload to GitHub.
